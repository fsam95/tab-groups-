We can attach an action button that opens a panel. The panel contains the following:
- The list of all tab groups at the top (maybe eventually we'll sort by usage) 
  - Each tab group has another 
- The option to add a new group 

Where were we?
  - Trying to set up the panel, or rather tests for the panel.
    - One of the two rather difficu

Panels
------
Content for the panel is provided by the html page

Tests
-----
Things we can test:
  1. Assert that pressing the ActionButton (is that what it's called?) 
     results in the panel showing up 

TODO
----
Go over variable access in Javascript
  - Can we access the action_button and panel?  
    - Yes but they have to be exported.
      - Everything in javascript has to be exported this is so silly

What should the panel look like? 
  - For now, we should get it to take a url and save it
    - yippee
